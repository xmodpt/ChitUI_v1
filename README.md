## Installation

### Recommended Installation Path

ChitUI should be installed to `~/ChitUI` for best compatibility:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ChitUI.git ChitUI
cd ChitUI
./install.sh
```

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   cd ~
   git clone <repository-url> ChitUI
   cd ChitUI
   ```

2. **Run the installer:**
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

   The installer will guide you through:
   - Installing Python dependencies
   - Setting up configuration directory (`~/.chitui`)
   - Optional: Virtual USB Gadget setup
   - Optional: Auto-start service installation

3. **Access the web interface:**
   - Local: `http://localhost:8080`
   - Network: `http://<your-pi-ip>:8080`

4. **Default login:**
   - Password: `admin`
   - You'll be prompted to change it on first login

## Requirements

- **Hardware:**
  - Raspberry Pi (any model)
  - For USB Gadget: Pi Zero, Zero W, Zero 2 W, or Pi 4/5 with OTG support

- **Software:**
  - Raspberry Pi OS (Debian-based)
  - Python 3.7+
  - Git (recommended)

## Usage

### Running ChitUI

**If you installed as a service:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status chitui    # Check status
sudo systemctl restart chitui   # Restart
journalctl -u chitui -f         # View logs
```

**If running manually:**
```bash
cd ~/ChitUI
./run.sh
```

Or directly:
```bash
cd ~/ChitUI
python3 main.py
```

### Configuration

Configuration files are stored in `~/.chitui/`:
- `chitui_settings.json` - Application settings, printer list
- `plugin_settings.json` - Plugin enable/disable states
- `gpio_relay_config.json` - GPIO relay configuration
- `ip_camera_config.json` - IP camera settings
- `service.log` - Service logs (if installed as service)

## Virtual USB Gadget

The Virtual USB Gadget makes your Raspberry Pi appear as a USB flash drive when connected to your 3D printer.

**Setup:**
1. Run the installer and choose "Yes" for USB Gadget setup
2. Reboot your Pi
3. Connect Pi's OTG USB port to printer's USB port
4. Files uploaded via ChitUI will appear on the printer

**Manual setup:**
```bash
cd ~/ChitUI
sudo ./scripts/virtual_usb_gadget_fixed.sh
```

**Testing:**
```bash
cd ~/ChitUI
bash ./scripts/check_usb_gadget.sh
```

## Plugins

### Managing Plugins

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Plugins**
2. Enable/disable plugins as needed
3. Upload custom plugins as `.zip` files
4. Refresh Python packages if needed

### Built-in Plugins

- **GPIO Relay Control** - Control up to 3 GPIO relays from the toolbar
- **IP Camera** - Stream RTSP/MJPEG cameras in a dedicated tab
- **Raspberry Pi Stats** - View CPU, memory, disk, and network stats
- **Terminal** - Direct terminal access to printer communication

See individual plugin README files in `plugins/` directory for details.

## Updating

```bash
cd ~/ChitUI
git pull
sudo systemctl restart chitui  # If running as service
```

## Troubleshooting

### Service won't start
```bash
sudo systemctl status chitui
journalctl -u chitui -n 50
```

### USB Gadget not working
```bash
cd ~/ChitUI
bash ./scripts/check_usb_gadget.sh
```

### Port already in use
```bash
sudo lsof -i :8080
# Kill the process using port 8080 if needed
```

### Printer not discovered
- Ensure printer and Pi are on the same network
- Check printer's network settings
- Try manual printer addition in Settings
